## 🌐 Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set output directory: `build`
4. Deploy! 🚀

### For Other Platforms:
- Use the `build` folder as your static site root
- Ensure your hosting platform supports client-side routing
- All routes should serve `index.html` for React Router to work

## ⚙️ Environment Variables
The app currently uses no custom environment variables beyond the standard React `NODE_ENV`.

## 📝 Notes
- All React Router routes are configured to work properly
- Static assets are optimized for caching
- No source maps in production for security and performance
- Build is ready for any static hosting platform

Ready for deployment! 🎉
